## What are the Flow Arts?
  - The Flow Arts are a form of new and quickly growing movement arts which combine elements of dance, physical awareness, and manipulation of an object. Flow is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in what they are doing. The umbrella of Flow Arts is wide. It can include and integrate juggling, spinning arts, dance, martial arts, and a variety of other disciplines. People practice these artforms as a medium for expression, health, discovery, and personal growth.
